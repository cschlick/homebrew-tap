# greasewood has no macOS build, on purpose (see docs/macos.md): the daemon is
# Linux-only, and a Mac joins a mesh via a minimal Lima VM. What brew installs
# is the Mac side of that story:
#   gw      run greasewood's CLI inside the node VM, from a Mac terminal
#   gw-mac  create/start the VM, route the whole Mac into the overlay
# plus the VM recipes and gateway files under <prefix>/share/greasewood.

    <<~EOS
      The node runs in a Lima VM; these commands drive it from the Mac:
        gw-mac         first run creates the VM; afterwards it starts the VM,
                       routes this Mac into the overlay, and syncs mesh names
        gw <command>   greasewood's CLI, run inside the VM (gw watch, gw join …)

      To join a mesh:
        gw-mac                                        # creates the VM
        # on your anchor:  sudo gw invite --hostname greasewood-node
        gw join <token>
        gw-mac                                        # routes the Mac in

      The mesh route is not persistent — rerun `gw-mac` after a reboot, or let
      it run itself:
        sudo gw-mac install-autostart   # once: root helper + scoped sudoers rule
        brew services start greasewood  # 'gw-mac up' every 2 min at login
    EOS
