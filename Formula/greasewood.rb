# Homebrew formula — the source of truth lives in the main repo; after
# tagging a release, `sh scripts/release-brew.sh` pins the tag's tarball
# sha256 here and pushes the copy the tap (cschlick/homebrew-tap) serves.
#
# This installs the NATIVE macOS node: the real `gw`, running the mesh on this
# Mac via wireguard-go (userspace WireGuard — macOS has no kernel module) and
# a launchd daemon that `sudo gw create`/`gw join` installs. It replaces the
# Lima-VM appliance this formula used to ship (preserved at repo tag
# lima-era-archive) — see docs/macos.md for what changed and the migration.

  # Bottle hosted in the tap (bottles/ dir) — built by hand on macOS/arm64
  # per release and pinned here afterwards. It is what makes `brew install`
  # work on a Mac WITHOUT the Xcode CLT: the formula itself compiles nothing
  # (wheels), but Homebrew's source-build gate refuses any non-bottled
  # install without the CLT. (GitHub's macOS runners lag the OS a version, so
  # their bottles would carry the wrong tag for current Macs — hence by hand.)
  # The block is (re)added after the release's bottle is built; a stale
  # previous-version block would make brew chase a bottle that doesn't exist.

    # virtualenv_create, which builds a pip-less venv and drives its own
    # vendored pip with --no-binary. Wheels are the point here: cryptography
    # from source needs a rust toolchain (and the CLT), which is exactly the
    # install friction this project avoids; the wheel is the same artifact
    # the Linux pipx install uses. greasewood itself is pure Python.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      greasewood needs root for the data plane (utun, routes, /etc/hosts):

        sudo gw create <mesh>     # start a new mesh (this Mac is the anchor)
        sudo gw join <token>      # or join an existing one

      Both install a launchd daemon (com.greasewood.<mesh>) that starts at
      boot and restarts on failure. Logs: /var/log/greasewood/<mesh>.log

      Access control (which machines can talk — the grant table, enforced
      as tunnel existence) works fully on macOS. What flows inside a tunnel
      is your host firewall's business, on every platform.
