# Homebrew formula — the source of truth lives in the main repo; after
# tagging a release, `sh scripts/release-brew.sh` pins the tag's tarball
# sha256 here and pushes the copy the tap (cschlick/homebrew-tap) serves.
#
# This installs the NATIVE macOS node: the real `gw`, running the mesh on this
# Mac via wireguard-go (userspace WireGuard — macOS has no kernel module) and
# a launchd daemon that `sudo gw create`/`gw join` installs. It replaces the
# Lima-VM appliance this formula used to ship (preserved at repo tag
# lima-era-archive) — see docs/macos.md for what changed and the migration.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      greasewood needs root for the data plane (utun, routes, /etc/hosts):

        sudo gw create <mesh>     # start a new mesh (this Mac is the anchor)
        sudo gw join <token>      # or join an existing one

      Both install a launchd daemon (com.greasewood.<mesh>) that starts at
      boot and restarts on failure. Logs: /var/log/greasewood/<mesh>.log

      Port enforcement (the grant table's port scopes) is not available on
      macOS yet — a pf backend is planned. Tunnel-level access control is
      fully enforced.
